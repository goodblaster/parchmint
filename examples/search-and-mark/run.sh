# The full search loop: archive a page, OCR its images, search the file,
# and produce a copy with every match highlighted — including matches
# that only exist as PIXELS inside images.
#
#   1. parch <url>          → one self-contained file with an embedded
#                             "text layer": every rendered word plus its
#                             page coordinates (TEXTLAYER.md)
#   2. parch index <file>   → OCR the archive's images (cover art,
#                             charts, frozen canvases…) into that layer.
#                             Works on the file alone — no browser, and
#                             explicitly opt-in because OCR is expensive
#   3. parch find  <file>   → search the file: no browser, no network,
#                             grep-like exit codes. `img` hits are text
#                             that lives inside an image
#   4. parch mark  <file>   → write a .marked.html copy: page-text
#                             matches wrapped in <mark>, image matches
#                             painted INTO the image (-grayscale mutes
#                             the image so the highlight pops). The
#                             original archive is never modified
#
# On apple.com, "music" typically appears both as page text AND inside
# Apple Music cover-art tiles — step 2 is what makes the tiles findable.
# This is the archive→index→retrieve→view pipeline in miniature: store
# the .html files anywhere (the text layer travels inside them), index
# the layers in your search system, and when a document is found, mark
# it for display.
